# 📜 ProofOfRead-bk – Smart Contract Backend

Welcome to the backend of the **ProofOfRead** project!  
This repo contains the smart contracts and related deployment/testing logic for publishing immutable literary works on the Ethereum blockchain.

---

## 🔧 Stack & Tools

- Hardhat (Ethereum development environment)
- Solidity (Smart contract language)
- Ethers.js (Testing and deployment)
- IPFS (External content hosting - referenced via hash)

---

## 📁 Project Structure

```
/contracts
  ImmutableWork.sol      // Main contract to publish and store literary works

/scripts
  deploy.js              // Deployment logic for smart contracts

/test
  ImmutableWork.test.js  // Unit tests using chai and ethers

hardhat.config.js        // Hardhat project configuration
```

---

## ✅ Smart Contract Overview

`ImmutableWork.sol` allows users to publish immutable literary works by storing a title and IPFS hash along with the author's address and timestamp.

---

## 🧪 How to Test

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

---

## 🚀 How to Deploy

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
```

---

## 💡 Next Steps

- Integrate with frontend
- Add NFT minting logic
- Payment support
```
